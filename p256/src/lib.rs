//! Pure Rust implementation of the NIST P-256 elliptic curve,
//! including support for the
//! [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)][ECDSA],
//! [Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)][ECDH], and general purpose
//! elliptic curve/field arithmetic which can be used to implement
//! protocols based on group operations.
//!
//! ## About NIST P-256
//!
//! NIST P-256 is a Weierstrass curve specified in FIPS 186-4:
//! Digital Signature Standard (DSS):
//!
//! <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf>
//!
//! Also known as `prime256v1` (ANSI X9.62) and `secp256r1` (SECG), P-256 is
//! included in the US National Security Agency's "Suite B" and is widely used
//! in Internet and connected device protocols like TLS, the X.509 PKI, and
//! Bluetooth.
//!
//! ## ⚠️ Security Warning
//!
//! The elliptic curve arithmetic contained in this crate has never been
//! independently audited!
//!
//! This crate has been designed with the goal of ensuring that secret-dependent
//! operations are performed in constant time (using the `subtle` crate and
//! constant-time formulas). However, it has not been thoroughly assessed to ensure
//! that generated assembly is constant time on common CPU architectures.
//!
//! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
//!
//! ## Minimum Supported Rust Version
//!
//! Rust **1.47** or higher.
//!
//! Minimum supported Rust version may be changed in the future, but it will be
//! accompanied with a minor version bump.
